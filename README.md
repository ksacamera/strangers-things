I would have loved another day on this. There are a bunch of features that aren't fully built, 
would love to add CSS, and didn't finish most of the buttons.
I still feel good about my progress with web delevopment though. Considering that I started from total scratch,
it's nice to take a step back and see what I can know now. Thanks to my wonderful instructors!
